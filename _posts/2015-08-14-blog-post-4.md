Choosing a PhD adviser is considered as one of the most important decision a research professional takes in life. Yet, many students mainly take this decision based on institution rankings, Google scholar citations or second hand recommendations. Due to various reasons, Google scholar citations is a least reliable metric for a new graduate student. In contrast, experienced academics have a knack of looking beyond such metrics while taking important decisions. We believe simple data driven attribution can make the knowledge necessary accessible to all to take such important decisions. This paper first highlights some of the prevalent practices that render the Google scholar metric ineffective and then argues for a simple data driven attribution paradigm as a solution to the problem. We believe a debate on this topic is necessary for awareness among students and would also encourage this issue to be addressed in an AI driven citation crawler such as semantic scholar.
