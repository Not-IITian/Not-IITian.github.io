Welcome to my homepage. I am a researcher at Ecole Polytechnique, supported by [ERC grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212108/factsheet/en). Previously, I was a CS PhD researcher for about a year at [MPI for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/people/alumni-and-former-members/abhishek-sharma/.) Before that, I graduated with a Masters degree in Applied Math with a formal training in machine learning and computer vision [MVA Masters programme](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/master-mva-cours-2015-2016-161721.kjsp?RH=1242415112528)

My research interests are centered around large scale learning on collections of 2D images, 3D geometric shapes and large networks or graphs. A particular focus of my research is towards unsupervised learning with a functional flavour.
