Welcome to my homepage. I am a researcher at Ecole Polytechnique, supported by [ERC grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212108/factsheet/en). Previously, I was a Marie Curie Early Stage researcher for about a year in the [famous](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-009-9119-4) Computer Vision Dept. (Bernt Schiele et al.) at MPI for Informatics, Saarbrucken. Before that, I graduated with a Masters degree in Applied Math with distinction and a formal training in machine learning and computer vision [MVA Masters programme](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/master-mva-cours-2015-2016-161721.kjsp?RH=1242415112528)

My research interests are centered around large scale learning on collections of 2D images, 3D geometric shapes and large networks or graphs. A particular focus of my research is on unsupervised learning and follows:

* Most Important Problems in Computer Vision: Correspondence, Correspondence and Correspondence (Takeo Kanade, CMU, 1997)

* Most important problem in Machine learning: Overfitting, Overfitting and Overfitting!

* Most important problem in geometry processing: Coming soon!
