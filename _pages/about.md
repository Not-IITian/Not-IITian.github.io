Welcome to my homepage. I am a (budding) applied mathematician, interested in all aspects of machine learning and its applications. 

Background
======
Previously, I was a PhD student for about a year at MPI for Informatics.
https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/people/alumni-and-former-members/abhishek-sharma/. Before that, I graduated with a diploma in Applied Math with a formal training in machine learning and computer vision. This was a great exposure as it gave the chance to learn things from the likes of Francis Bach and Stephane Mallat.
